**!! Read Step By Step Carefully !!!     (Internet Must)**

# Visual Studio Code INSTALLATION
        --> https://code.visualstudio.com/download
        --> If Unable to open Link "Do this = (HOLD ctrl + lift Click)"
        --> Click to Download, Windows 10,11
        --> If using Mac, Download Mac 'macOS'
        --> Open the downloaded VS Code setup (double click)
        --> During the setup, allow all required permissions (tick the necessary options).
        --> This will create desktop shortcuts and enable right-click options to open files in VS Code.

## Step 1: Python Installation
        https://www.python.org/downloads/    

        --> If unable to open the link, hold `Ctrl` and left-click on the link.
        --> During the installation process, make sure to allow all permissions (tick the necessary options).
        --> This ensures proper setup, including environment variables.

**Below Steps are Required to Run the Practical Program**

## Step 2: Check Python Installed or Not (Also, If you Installed Already)
            -->  Go to Open Command Prompt (In Search 'CMD')
            -->  python --version    (& Enter) then,
            -->  pip --version       (& Enter)
            -->  If shows any Error, Install properly following the Step 1

## Step 3: OpenCV Libray Installation
            -->  Go to Open Command Prompt  (In Search 'CMD')
            -->  pip install opencv-python  
                    (& Enter) then,
            -->  pip install opencv-contrib-python 
                    (& Enter)

## Step 4: If Check the OpenCV Library Successfully Installed or Not
            --> Create a file named 'opencv.py'
            --> Open 'opencv.py' file any TextEditor Like 'VSCode, PyCharm, Spyder etc.
            
            Copy & Paste the below three line Code:

                import cv2
                print("OpenCV version:", cv2.__version__)
                print("OpenCV Successfully Installed")

            --> Open the code on Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
            --> To Run the code, Go to terminal or press (ctrl + shift + ~)
            --> Check the code folder path is correct like "C:\Users\sridhar\MSc Python>" type below command
            --> python 'file_name' (or) 
            --> python opencv.py
            --> If shows the OpenCV Suucessfully Installed
            --> Else "Again Follow the Step 4"

## Step 5: PIL Libray Installation
            -->  Go to Open Command Prompt  (In Search 'CMD')
            -->  pip install pillow 
                    (& Enter)

## Step 6: If Check the PIL Library Successfully Installed or Not
            --> Create a file named 'pil.py'
            --> Open 'pil.py' file any TextEditor Like 'VSCode, PyCharm, Spyder etc.
            
            Copy & Paste the below three line Code:

                import PIL
                print(PIL.__version__)
                print("PIL Successfully Installed")

            --> Open the code on Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
            --> To Run the code, Go to terminal or press (ctrl + shift + ~)
            --> Check the code folder path is correct like "C:\Users\sridhar\MSc Python>" type below command
            --> python 'file_name' (or) 
            --> python opencv.py
            --> If shows the OpenCV Suucessfully Installed
            --> Else "Again Follow the Step 4"

## Step 7: Now you can practice your program
            --> If you facing any kind of error, after following the Above steps
            --> Contact SRIDHAR (or)
            --> Gmail : programmer.sridhar@gmail.com
